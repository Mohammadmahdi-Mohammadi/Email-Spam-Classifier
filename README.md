# Email-Spam-Classifier
In this exercise, you will train the Naïve bayes model to classify spam and non-spam emails. You should
follow three main steps in this question:

a) Explain the most important methods of text data pre-processing and use them for your
dataset (you can use a library like NLTK). Visualization can also be a part of pre-processing.

b) Train a Naïve bayes model that classifies the email as either spam or non-spam (Note: you
cannot use the library). explain how this model works in theory.

c) Finally, test the model's performance. (Recall Score, Precision Score, and F1 Score, etc.)
